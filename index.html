	<h1>OC CTO Forum</h1>
	<p>OC CTO Forum is a local private group of Chief Technology Officers in Orange County, CA. <br><br>

	<h2>Meetings</h2>
	We meet in person once a month on the third Friday of the Month from 8-10AM.<br><br>

	We are aware of other CTO groups in the Orange County area, but are unique to our meeting format.<br><br>

	All meetings have a topic, but are roundtable format. Attendees bring their own experiences to share and contribute.<br><br>

	The setting is typically private and intimate in a conference room where CTOs feel safe to share private information and seek feedback and advice from other CTOs on a variety of matters.<br><br>

	<h2>Membership</h2>
	In order to maintain trust and intimacy in the group, we have strict membership policies. At the time of joining one must:<br><br>

	-Be in a technical leadership role and managing at least three technical employees. (We make this rule basic because someone may be a "CTO" of a three person startup while another is listed as a "Director" with 50 staff at a Fortune 500)<br>
	-Be available to meet Friday mornings 8-10 AM in Orange County at least twice a year.<br>
	-Not be a recruiter or interested in actively selling anything to the other members of the group.<br><br>

	As mentioned, these are requirements at the time of joining, but not necissarily ongoing, meaning, if an existing member CTO is in between jobs, they are still encouraged and welcome to continue attending and contributing.<br><br>

	If you are interested in joining you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchQu0CxGK9SK7EDQkNKPb8nK6_o0ORxHHmz_qghj_5mEiQiQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">apply here</a>.</p>
